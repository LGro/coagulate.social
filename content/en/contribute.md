# Contribute {.title .is-2}

Coagulate is an open community project to which you can start contributing today.
And you do not need to be a programmer for that.


## Feedback {.title .is-3}

While using Coagulate, you noticed something that you would like to share?
Do you have suggestions for improvement, or did you find an unintuitive aspect?
Please write us about your impression and what you would wish to change at feedback|at|coagulate.social, or create an [issue](https://github.com/LGro/coagulate/issues/new) in case you are familiar with GitHub.


## Translation {.title .is-3}

You speak another language aside from English or German and would like to help translate Coagulate?
Until we are ready to leverage platforms like [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/), please share translated text via a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/LGro/coagulate/issues/new) with us.
In case you would like to help translate this website, then create an [issue here](https://github.com/LGro/coagulate.social/issues/new).


## Documentation {.title .is-3}

Both for the documentation aimed at developers in the [app repository](https://github.com/LGro/coagulate), as well as for the [website repository](https://github.com/LGro/coagulate.social/issues/new), we need a hand.
You can help add alternatives and how Coagulate is different, or sharpen the current description as well as elaborate on our plans for the future.


## Development {.title .is-3}

You are interested in developing with Dart and Flutter, or curious what other aspects are relevant for developing a mobile cross-platform app?
Then have a look at the Coagulate [repository on GitHub.com](https://github.com/LGro/coagulate).
Tasks that are especially suitable for new contributors are marked ["good first issue"](https://github.com/LGro/coagulate/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
More generally, you can also have a look at where we state ["help wanted"](https://github.com/LGro/coagulate/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
